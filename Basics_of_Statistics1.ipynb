        "    Random sampling plays a crucial role in making inferences about populations because it ensures that the sample selected is representative of the larger population. This representativeness is key to the validity and reliability of the conclusions drawn. Here's a breakdown of its role and importance:\n",

        "    1.Minimizing Bias\n",

        "    \n",
        "    B.This process reduces selection bias, ensuring that no particular subgroup is overrepresented or underrepresented in the sample. By doing so, the sample better reflects the diversity of the population.\n",

        "    3.Supporting Statistical Analysis\n",
